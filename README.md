# ImageProcessing
An image processing library that I have started to develop (still in development), this is version 1.0.

This image processing library was used for my rapid 3D imaging project.

This library currently includes:
- A folder containing an image read and write library, and a small applet to view an image
- Edge detection (only Sobel operator implemented)
- An histogram normalization process
- A simple median filter noise removal process
- A source folder that holds an abstract class for an image process
- A binarizing threshold 
- An unsharp masking process for sharpening

Note that this library is still in development.
